I have read the entierty of the Art and Science of Java and solved the majority of the exercises in the book. Feel free to correct, and
comment any of my solutions. I am a hobby developer and always looking to learn and better my coding skills. 

The assignments that I have solved are available to download at:  https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A.

Please note that I am using the Stanfrord Java library to complete these exercises as recommended in the Stanford course CS106A available
at https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A.
