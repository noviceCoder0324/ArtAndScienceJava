Welcome to my GitHub! I solved the majority of the exercises in the book Art and Science of Java. Feel free to correct, and
comment any of my solutions. I am a hobby developer and a full time medical doctor who is always looking to learn and develop new skills. 

The Stanford CS 106A course has several free assignments, my solutions are availale here as well.
The assignments that I have solved are available to download at:  https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A.

Please note that I am using the Stanfrord Java library to complete these exercises as recommended in the Stanford course CS106A available 
to the public for free at https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS106A.
